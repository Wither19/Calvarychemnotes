                        Chemical changes <em>always</em> have a change in composition. Physical changes <em>never</em> do so.
                        
                         Burn, rot, rust, decompose, ferment, and explode are words use to describe chemical changes.
                        
                         A substance's ability to undergo a specific chemical change is a <span class="vocab">chemical property</span>.
                        
                         Breaking off a chunk of coal is physical, lighting it ablaze and having it burn is chemical.
                        
                         Possible indicators of chemical changes are changes in color and temperature, emission of gas, and formation of precipitate.

                         However, you cannot be assured of chemical change even with any of these clues unless you <em>test the composition of the product against its' reactants</em>.

                         Addition and subtraction in scientific notation requires that the exponents be the same.

                      The Greek philospher Democritus (ca. 370 BC) was the first person to surmise the existence of atoms. He was, however inaccurate in the belief that they were indivisible and indestructible. He also didn't use the Scientific Method to make these assertions.
                      
                      
                      John Dalton (1766-1864), an English chemistry teacher, would go on to confirm Democritus' musings of the existence of the small building blocks of matter.
                      
                      
                      <span class="vocab">Dalton's Atomic Theory</span> states:
                      
                      All atoms of a given element are the <em>same</em>
                      
                      Two atoms pertaining to different elements are <em>different</em>
                      
                      Atoms from different elements can combine in fixed ratios to create compounds
                      
                      Atoms <em>cannot</em> be changed into other elements as a result of chemical reaction. They can only be separated, joined or rearranged in various ways.
                      
                      
                      Dalton receives more credit for the discovery of Atoms than Democritus 2000 years earlier, because Dalton could experiment and produce his assertions in real life. Democritus didn't experiment because the Scientific Method didn't yet exist.

                    The only thing John Dalton happened to miss is that atoms can in fact, be further divided. Although it certainly doesn't end well for anyone who does so without adequately backing away.
                    
                    In 1897, Another Englishman, Physicist J. J. Thompson, had discovered the <span class="different">Electron</span>. Thompson originally coined the negatively charged <span class="vocab">Subatomic Particles</span> 'corpuscules'.
                    
                    American Physicist Robert A. Milikan determined the charge of a single electron.
                    
                    Atoms have no net electric charge. They are neutral.
                    
                    You can't have a fraction of an electrical charge in atoms.
                    
                    
                    Eugen Goldstein while observing the same Cathode Ray which allowed Thompson to conclude that electrons existed, flipped the experiment to observe <span class="same">Protons</span>.
                    
                    James Chadwick discovered the <span class="neutral">Neutron</span>.
                    
                    
                    Ernest Rutherford from New Zealand, in an effort to confirm the Plum-Pudding model, shoots a beam of double-positive charged helium atoms (The atoms are missing two electrons) at a sheet of gold foil.
                    
                    Based on Rutherford's results, he concluded that atoms are mostly empty space, as opposed to bunched together as J. J. Thompson previously stated in the Plum-pudding model.
                    
                    To illustrate the emptiness around the nucleus, If atoms were the size of football fields, nuclei would be marbles.
                    
                    The new model was called Rutherford's atomic model and he received a Nobel Prize in 1908 for his discovery.

                      Even finding out about many elements in the 1960's, he had some unknowns. These unknown elements were discovered years later.

                      This table is much more complete and organized, elements being sorted in rows (periods) by energy levels, and 
                      the columns (groups) sort by certain sets of shared chemical and/or physical properties.
                      The three primary types of elements are metals (80%), non-metals, and metalloids.
                      Most metals are malleable and can be pounded into sheets.
                      Nonmetals are gases at room temperature. The few exceptions are <span class="nonmetal">Sulfur (S)</span>, and <span class="nonmetal">Phosphorus (P)</span> which are normally solids, and <span class="nonmetal">Bromine (Br)</span> which is liquid. While metallic properties are rather *IRON-CLAD*, One blanket set of non-metallic properties is impossible to deduce given the variation of forms they can take on. But they tend to take on properties opposite of metals.
                      Metalloids hold the smallest presence on the Periodic Table, and holds some properties of both metals and non-metals.

                      Elements with Black text are solids at room temperature, <span style="color: red">red</span> means gas, and <span style="color: blue;">blue</span> means liquid. Only two elements are liquid at room temp, being Mercury and Bromine.
                      
                      Elements in gray denote that they do not naturally occur.
                      
                      The elements in groups 1A through 7A are called <span class="vocab">Representative Elements</span>, because they show the widest variety of physical and chemical properties.
                      
                      The term 'inner transition metal' is rather misleading, given they're in far greater quantities than a lot of normal metals.

                    <p>
                      <span class="vocab">Atomic Radius</span> is the size of the nucleus of a given atom. It is also half the distance between two identical nuclei when they are joined, measured in picometers (pm).
                      
                      Further down (by groups) the periodic table you go, the larger the nuclei you will find for the respective elements' atoms. The size decreases as you move right (by period).
                      This is the trend for atomic size.
                      
                      Net positive ions are called <span class="vocab">Cations</span> and net negative ions are called <span class="vocab">Anions</span>. Nonmetals tend to form anions, and metals tend to form cations.
                      The energy needed to remove an electron from an atom is <span class="vocab">Ionization Energy</span>.  
                      <span class="vocab">First Ionization Energy</span> is the ionization energy needed for the first time an electron is removed from an atom. The energy requirement for first ionization energy increases left to right and decreases top to bottom. This is the inverse of the atomic size trend.
                      
                      The first ionization energy trend is identical to the <span class="vocab">ionic size</span> trend.

                    <p>
                      As you increase in groups, the amount of valence electrons increases (Group 1A has 1, Group 8A has 8, except for Helium).
                      
                      <span class="vocab">Valence Electrons</span> are the electrons found in the highest occupied energy level of an atom.
                      
                      Cations are made when an atom loses one or more valence electrons. 
                      
                      Anions are made upon receiving one or more valence electrons.

                    <p>
                      <span class="vocab">Ionic Compounds</span> are compounds composed of cations and anions, and are <span class="neutral">neutral</span> (The total negative charge is equal to the total positive charge). <span class="vocab">Ionic Bonds</span> are the electrostatic forces hold ions together in the compound. 
                      A <span class="vocab">formula unit</span> is the lowest whole-number ratio of ions in an ionic compound. The majority of ionic compounds are crystals at room temperature, are rather stable and have high melting points. Ionic compounds can conduct electricity when melted or dissolved in water. The <span class="vocab">Coordination Number</span> refers to the amount of ions of opposite charge that surround the ion in the crystal.
