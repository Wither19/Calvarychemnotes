                        Chemical changes <em>always</em> have a change in composition. Physical changes <em>never</em> do so.

                        <br> Burn, rot, rust, decompose, ferment, and explode are words use to describe chemical changes.

                        <br>
                        <br> Possible indicators of chemical changes are changes in color and temperature, emission of gas, and formation of precipitate.
